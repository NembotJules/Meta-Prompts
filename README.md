# Meta-Prompts
A collection of Meta prompts for  various use cases.

LLMs give almost everybody the power to code now. We're moving from maneuver to architect, system designer, and meta thinker. Now, your ability to design a complete system in your head and concisely tell it to an LLM is the real differentiating factor. For that and depending on the use cases, we need what I call a meta-prompt or prompt template. A prompt template allows you to structure the thinking process of an LLM and make it respond following a certain structure that you provided. This repo will serve as a collection of powerful prompt templates in various topics Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Philosophy, Esoterism, Startups, and more.
